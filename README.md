Livemessage is a client-sided DM manager for Minecraft 1.12.2. It is inspired by older chat applications such as AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger.

Livemessage stores DMs locally and only sends messages through the Minecraft server you are playing on - no messages are sent through or to any other server. **This means you can chat with people who do not use this mod.**
